# What is it ?

The purpose of this template is to provide a **typesafe**, **production ready** web API, and a full **development environment** with the best tooling possible

It gives your project a clean base to start and follows development **good practices**, essentially focusing on **maintenability** and **extensibility**

Lastly, it aims to save developers a lot of time since all **nasty configurations** are already written (typescript, eslint, jest, docker, CI, ...) and **technologies** are already chosen (language, testing framework, database, ORM, ...)

![Deployment example](https://github.com/LeChatErrant/API-template/blob/master/.github/assets/deployment.gif)

> This project is fully integrated with **[devops-template](https://github.com/LeChatErrant/devops-template)** **(work still in progress)**, which provide a full infrastructure on Kubernetes along with its tooling
>
> Don't hesitate to share your improvements or to give feedback on Discord **(LeChatErrant#6074)** :wink:
